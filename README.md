# BuildPulse Example Project: JavaScript + Mocha

This is an example [Mocha](https://mochajs.org) project demonstrating how to send test results to [BuildPulse](https://buildpulse.io) to help you detect, track, and eliminate flaky tests.

## Connect Mocha to BuildPulse

After starting a [free trial](https://github.com/marketplace/buildpulse/plan/MDIyOk1hcmtldHBsYWNlTGlzdGluZ1BsYW40NzM5#pricing-and-setup), you can add BuildPulse to your project in just a few quick steps:

1. If you haven't already done so, set up Mocha to output JUnit XML reports for your test results. [[example][commit-for-xml-reports]]

2. Then, configure your build to send the JUnit XML reports to BuildPulse. [[example][commit-for-buildpulse-integration]]

    The [configuration][commit-for-buildpulse-integration] relies on your BuildPulse account ID, repository ID, key, and secret. You'll see this information when viewing your repository on buildpulse.io.

    This example uses GitHub Actions CI, but you can integrate just as easily with other CI providers as described below.

## Works with the CI you already have

BuildPulse offers integrations for:

- **CircleCI** [[docs](https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/workshop64/buildpulse)]
- **GitHub Actions** [[docs](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/buildpulse)]
- **Semaphore** [[docs](https://github.com/Workshop64/buildpulse-semaphore)]
- **Travis CI** [[docs](https://github.com/Workshop64/buildpulse-travis-ci)]
- Buildkite (available in early access)
- Jenkins (available in early access)
